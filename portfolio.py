""" course goals to highlight (pick 4 of them plz)
1: Detail differences between supervised and unsupervised learning tasks and methods

2: Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms in python and assess their efficacy

3: Compare and assess the efficacy of machine learning algorithms and results using evaluation metrics and in terms of the context of the data's domain

4: Develop an appreciation for ethical implications of machine learning algorithms

5: Work iteratively and reflectively to apply machine learning techniques to a data set of interest with informative documentation, written for a variety of audiences
